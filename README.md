Overview


This project implements a GUI-based measurement and data visualization system using Python. It integrates powerful open-source libraries to automate and control popular laboratory instruments, acquire data, and visualize results in real time. Designed for computer-based measurement labs, it simplifies instrument communication and enhances workflow efficiency.

WorkFlow :

The Instrument is controlled through pyvisa backend running in the computer.The main program sets the desired voltage & measures the current respectively to plot the characteristics of V-I
